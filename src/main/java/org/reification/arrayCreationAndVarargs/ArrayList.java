    /**
     * In Section 1.4 we discussed the method java.util.Arrays.asList, which is declared as
     * follows:
     * public static <E> List<E> asList(E... arr)
     *
     * For instance, here are three calls to this method:
     * List<Integer> a = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
     * List<Integer> b = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6);
     * List<List<Integer>> x = Arrays.asList(a, b); // generic array creation
     *
     * Recall that an argument list of variable length is implemented by packing the arguments
     * into an array and passing that. Hence these three calls are equivalent to the following:
     *
     * List<Integer> a = Arrays.asList(new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3 });
     * List<Integer> b = Arrays.asList(new Integer[] { 4, 5, 6 });
     * List<List<Integer>> x
     * = Arrays.asList(new List<Integer>[] { a, b }); // generic array creation
     *
     * The first two calls are fine, but since List<Integer> is not a reifiable type, the third
     * warns of an unchecked generic array creation at compile time
     *
     * This warning can be confusing, particularly since that line of source code does not
     * contain an explicit instance of array creation!
     * A similar problem occurs if one attempts to create a list of a generic type. Here is a
     * method that uses Arrays.asList to create a list of length one containing a given element:
     *
     * public static List<E> singleton(E elt) {
     * return Arrays.asList(elt); // generic array creation
     * }
     *
     * This also generates a warning, which can be confusing for the same reasons.
     * Normally, generic array creation reports an error. As a workaround, one can create the
     * array at a reifiable type and perform an unchecked cast. That workaround is not available for the array creation
     * that is implicit in the use of varargs, so in this case generic
     * array creation issues a warning rather than an error. A generic array creation warning
     * is just like an unchecked warning, in that it invalidates the cast-iron guarantee that
     * accompanies generics. It is not too difficult to take each of the previous examples where
     * a mishap occurs as the result of an unchecked warning, and create a similar example
     * using varargs where a generic array creation warning is issued instead.
     * In our opinion, the convenience offered by varargs is outweighed by the danger inherent
     * in unchecked warnings, and we recommend that you never use varargs when the argument is of a nonreifiable type.
     * For instance, in both of the preceding examples, instead of using Arrays.asList, we would have created a new
     * ArrayList and used the
     * add method, even though this is less convenient and less efficient.
     * The need for generic array creation warnings and the associated workarounds would
     * not have arisen if the vararg notation had been defined to pack arguments into a list
     * rather than an array, taking Tâ€¦ to be equivalent to List<T> rather than T[]. Unfortunately, the vararg notation
     * was designed before this problem was fully understood.*/
