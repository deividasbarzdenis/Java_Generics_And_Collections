     * The method checkedList in the convenience class Collections takes a list and a class
     * token and returns a checked view of the list; whenever an attempt is made to add an
     * element to the checked view, reflection is used to check that the element belongs to the
     * specified class before adding it to the underlying list (see Section 17.3.3). Using a
     * checked list view will cause a class cast exception to be raised inside the method addI
     * tems when it attempts to add a string to the list. Since the method getItems creates its
     * own list, the client cannot use a wrapper in the same way. However, adding an empty
     * loop at the point where the list is returned can guarantee that the error is caught close
     * to the offending method call.
     * Checked lists provide useful guarantees only when the list elements are of a reifiable
     * type. If you want to apply these techniques when the list is not of a reifiable type, you
     * might want to consider applying the specialization technique of Section 8.3.*/
